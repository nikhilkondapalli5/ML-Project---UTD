The top 10 ranks can then be extracted and visualized as a horizontal bar graph using the Seaborn library.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can analyze and plot the data:\n\n1. **Extract and Sort the Data**: Sort the job titles based on their AverageGross in descending order.\n2. **Select Top 10**: Fetch the top 10 job titles with the highest AverageGross.\n3. **Visualization**: Use Seaborn to plot the data as a horizontal bar graph.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how this can be done using Python:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data input\ndata = [\n    {'JOBTITLE': \"STATE'S ATTORNEY\", 'AverageGross': 238681.04},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'DIRECTOR PUBLIC WORKS', 'AverageGross': 161753.56},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'CITY SOLICITOR', 'AverageGross': 161139.85},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'MAYOR', 'AverageGross': 159380.0},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'CITY AUDITOR', 'AverageGross': 144862.41},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'EXECUTIVE LEVEL III', 'AverageGross': 139055.35},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'STAFF AIDE TO THE FIRE CHIEF', 'AverageGross': 134865.2},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'ADMINISTRATOR COURTS', 'AverageGross': 118259.14},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'SHERIFF', 'AverageGross': 115459.04},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'Battalion Fire Chief EMS EMT-P', 'AverageGross': 115288.79}\n]\n\n# Convert to DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Sort by AverageGross in descending order\ndf_sorted = df.sort_values(by='AverageGross', ascending=False)\n\n# Select top 10\ntop_10 = df_sorted.head(10)\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.barplot(x='AverageGross', y='JOBTITLE', data=top_10, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Top 10 Job Titles by Average Gross Salary')\nplt.xlabel('Average Gross Salary')\nplt.ylabel('Job Title')\nplt.grid(axis='x')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **DataFrame Creation**: The data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.\n- **Sorting**: The DataFrame is sorted by the 'AverageGross' column in descending order to find the top earners.\n- **Selecting Top 10**: We extract the first 10 entries of the sorted DataFrame to analyze the highest salaries.\n- **Plotting**: Using Seaborn's barplot function, we create a horizontal bar graph where the y-axis represents job titles and the x-axis represents their corresponding average gross salaries.\n\n### Note:\nMake sure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`) to run the code successfully."}

{"role": "tool", "content": "To analyze the provided dataset and determine the job titles with the highest average gross values, we will first compile the data and then rank them. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what we need to do:\n1. Sort the data by `AverageGross` in descending order.\n2. Select the top 10 job titles.\n3. Plot the results using seaborn in a horizontal bar graph.\n\n### Step 1: Data Preparation\nLet's organize the data and sort it.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Given data\ndata = [\n    {'JOBTITLE': \"STATE'S ATTORNEY\", 'AverageGross': 238681.04},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'DIRECTOR PUBLIC WORKS', 'AverageGross': 161753.56},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'CITY SOLICITOR', 'AverageGross': 161139.85},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'MAYOR', 'AverageGross': 159380.00},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'CITY AUDITOR', 'AverageGross': 144862.41},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'EXECUTIVE LEVEL III', 'AverageGross': 139055.35},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'STAFF AIDE TO THE FIRE CHIEF', 'AverageGross': 134865.20},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'ADMINISTRATOR COURTS', 'AverageGross': 118259.14},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'SHERIFF', 'AverageGross': 115459.04},\n    {'JOBTITLE': 'Battalion Fire Chief EMS EMT-P', 'AverageGross': 115288.79}\n]\n\n# Convert to DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Sort by AverageGross in descending order\ndf_sorted = df.sort_values(by='AverageGross', ascending=False)\n\n# Select the top 10 job titles\ntop_10 = df_sorted.head(10)\n\n# Display the top 10\nprint(top_10)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Data Visualization\nNow we will create a horizontal bar graph using seaborn.\n\n```python\n# Set up the matplotlib figure\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Create horizontal bar plot\nsns.barplot(data=top_10, x='AverageGross', y='JOBTITLE', palette='viridis')\n\n# Set plot title and labels\nplt.title('Top 10 Job Titles by Average Gross Salary')\nplt.xlabel('Average Gross Salary')\nplt.ylabel('Job Titles')\nplt.grid(axis='x')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Overview of the Top 10 Job Titles\nAfter processing the dataset and visualizing it, here are the top 10 job titles based on their average gross salary:\n\n1. **STATE'S ATTORNEY**: $238,681.04\n2. **DIRECTOR PUBLIC WORKS**: $161,753.56\n3. **CITY SOLICITOR**: $161,139.85\n4. **MAYOR**: $159,380.00\n5. **CITY AUDITOR**: $144,862.41\n6. **EXECUTIVE LEVEL III**: $139,055.35\n7. **STAFF AIDE TO THE FIRE CHIEF**: $134,865.20\n8. **ADMINISTRATOR COURTS**: $118,259.14\n9. **SHERIFF**: $115,459.04\n10. **Battalion Fire Chief EMS EMT-P**: $115,288.79\n\nThis analysis captures the top positions and their corresponding average gross salaries, with a clear visual representation through the bar graph."}
